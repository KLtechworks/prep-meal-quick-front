# Prep Meal Quick Frontend

This project contains a simple React application served from a single `index.html` file. It provides:

- Manual input to classify foods as low, medium, or high Glycemic Index.
- A form to enter age group, exercise level, and daily calorie target.
- Quick guides for weight loss, muscle gain, maintaining health, and fast meal prep.
- Minimalist layout with a green theme using Tailwind CSS via CDN.

## Running

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. The page uses CDN links for React and Tailwind, so no build steps or package installations are required.
